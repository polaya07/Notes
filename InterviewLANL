My interview is with:
1. Terry Turton: " Her current work focuses on improved colormaps for scientific visualization and creating, implementing, running and analyzing user studies to improve visualizations of scientific data." (projects: https://datascience.lanl.gov/colorstudies.html)
2. Li-Ta (Ollie) Lo: "His current research interest includes data science, large-scale visualization and analysis, data-parallel programming and software engineering for scientific computing."
3. Chris Biwer: "His experience at Los Alamos and research interests include data analysis of physical experiments, optimization of analysis methods, and developing scientific workflows."
All of them are physicists.
